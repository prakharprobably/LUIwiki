## How do I learn linux
There is no single way to learn Linux, and it largely depends on what you choose to do with your install, with many different non linear paths that can be pursued at any time, and in largely any order. However, it is recommended that you start by learning the basic commands that will let you navigate the system.
### Free Courses
1. [linuxjourney](https://labex.io/linuxjourney). One of the best resources for learning linux basics. After going through it, you'll know everything about linux internals like the kernel, shell and filesystem and will know how to navigate using the command line like a pro.
2. [Overthewire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). Another great resource for getting the basics of linux down. This is an interactive game designed to teach the linux basics.
3. [LFS-101](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/): A free course by The Linux Foundation that helps you develop a good working knowledge of linux using both the GUI(graphical interface) and CLI(Command line). It takes you through basics like file operations and text manipulation and intermediate things like networking and bash scripting.

### Books
1. ["How linux works"](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks3): This helps you understand how stuff really works under the hood. It does use simple English however the concepts the author describe often are usually very unfamiliar to new readers because often other materials never explain how stuff works under the hood. It is recommend to read this after "The Linux Command Line."
2. ["The linux command line" by William Shotts](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php): A very well laid out book for beginners. Not too lengthy and uses simple English, but you will certainly appreciate the light humor throughout the book. The author assumes a working linux installation, this book is actually more about CLI than "Linux" but the distinction is usually trivial as GUI change way too often and most of linux power is really in the CLI. The author is very pro FOSS and seems like a very nice guy in general. The book is free to download and is licensed appropriately.
3. [Linux Command line and shell scripting bible, 5th ed](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Linux+Command+Line+and+Shell+Scripting+Bible%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781394364947): This is a comprehensive guide that teaches users how to effectively use the command line, as well as the advanced topics, working examples, and real-world applications that equip you to administer Linux systems. It contains easy to follow tutorials of multiple shells like zsh, tcsh and the korn shell. 
4. [UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook, 5th Edition by Trent R. Hein, Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Ben Whaley, Dan Mackin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-and-linux/9780134278308/): This is a giant book and aimed to be a reference manual. This one is not aimed at general linux users but those who are into sysadmin work. It is a guide to configuring and maintaining any UNIX or Linux system. It covers best practices around areas like storage management, network design and administration, web hosting and scale-out, automation, configuration management, performance analysis, virtualization, DNS, security, management of IT service organizations, and much more.



### Other resources
1. Man pages: If you want to learn about what a specific package or command does, the simplest and best way is to check its man page. Just run `man <package-name>` (if it's a package) or man `man <command-name>` (if it's a command) in the terminal. It lists out all the availabe features, usage and options.
2. [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page): A vast and comprehensive resource about arch linux but it also provides guidance and directs to relevant sources on topics outside its scope but still related to linux. If there is something related to linux, you can find it on arch wiki(this is not an overstatement, that's how good the archwiki is).
